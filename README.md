# 🚀 GitOnBoard

**GitOnBoard** is a technical showcase designed to demonstrate advanced integration between **React/Next.js** and **Blockchain** protocols. This decentralized freelance marketplace focuses on securing mission milestones through on-chain validation and transparent ownership management.

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of GitOnBoard is to bridge the gap between traditional freelance platforms and Web3 technology. It provides a streamlined interface for developers and clients to agree on missions, using blockchain as a source of truth for validating project completion and transferring digital assets (NFTs/Titles).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | **ReactJS** / **Next.js** (App Router) |
| **Blockchain Integration** | **Safe SDK** / **Viem** (or Ethers.js) |
| **State Management** | **React Hooks** & **Context API** |
| **Web3 Core** | **Wallet Connection** (RainbowKit/Wagmi) & Transaction Handling |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS |

## ✨ Key Features (WIP)

* **Decentralized Mission Proposals:** Create and manage freelance contracts directly on-chain.
* **3-Party Consensus Workflow:** Implementation of a secure validation flow involving the Developer, the Client, and a Trusted Third Party.
* **Safe Wallet Integration:** Leveraging the Safe (ex-Gnosis) protocol to handle complex multi-signature logic for asset security.
* **Real-time Web3 UI:** Responsive dashboard showing live transaction statuses and wallet connection states.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

This project serves as a deep dive into:

1. **Smart Contract Interaction:** Reading and writing data to the blockchain from a React environment.
2. **Complex Signature Schemes:** Using the Safe SDK to collect and submit off-chain signatures.
3. **Modern UX for Web3:** Designing intuitive interfaces for complex cryptographic actions.
